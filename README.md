# Golang - vue.js - Docker - Kubernetes

Tutorial about dockerize golang web application with vue.js then deploy it to Kubernetes.

## Part 1 - Dockerize the App
1. [Initiate modules](#initiate-modules)
2. [Build the image](#build-the-image)
3. [Running container in the background](#running-container-in-the-background)

### Initiate modules

Module support is disabled by default for all code inside $GOPATH so that 1.11 behaves like 1.10 did. To enable it, you have to set GO111MODULE=on in your environment.

	export GO111MODULE=on
	go mod init
	go get github.com/labstack/echo
	go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3

Then 2 new files have been created in our folder: go.mod and go.sum.

### Build the image

We can now build an image using Dockerfile by execute this command:

	docker build -t govue .

We can now verify that our image exists on our machine by typing this command:

	docker images

### Running container in the background

In order to run this newly created image and if we want to have it run permanently in the background, execute this command:

	docker run -p 8080:8000 -d govue

If we open up http://localhost:8080 within our browser, we should see that our application is successfully running.

In order to view the list of containers running in the background, execute this command:

	docker ps


## Part 2 - Deploy the Dockerize App to Kubernetes
1. [Build the container image](#build-the-container-image)
2. [Upload the container image](#upload-the-container-image)
3. [Run container locally](#run-container-locally)
4. [Create a container cluster](#create-a-container-cluster)
5. [Deploy the application](#deploy-the-application)
6. [Expose the application to the Internet](#expose-the-application-to-the-internet)

### Build the container image

Authenticate by execute this command:

	gcloud auth login

Set the PROJECT_ID environment variable to your Google Cloud project ID. This variable will be used to associate the container image with your project's Container Registry by execute this command:

	export PROJECT_ID=charged-gravity-258513

To build the container image of this application and tag it for uploading, run the following command:

	docker build -t gcr.io/charged-gravity-258513/govue:v1 .

You can run docker images command to verify that the build was successful:

	docker images

### Upload the container image

First, configure Docker command-line tool to authenticate to Container Registry (you need to run this only once):

	gcloud auth configure-docker

You can now use the Docker command-line tool to upload the image to your Container Registry:

	docker push gcr.io/charged-gravity-258513/govue:v1

### Run container locally

To test your container image using your local Docker engine, run the following command:

	docker run --rm -p 8080:8000 gcr.io/charged-gravity-258513/govue:v1

### Create a container cluster

Set your project ID and Compute Engine zone options for the gcloud tool:

	gcloud config set project charged-gravity-258513
	gcloud config set compute/zone asia-east1-a

Run the following command to create a two-node cluster named govue-cluster:

	gcloud container clusters create govue-cluster --num-nodes=2

It may take several minutes for the cluster to be created. Once the command has completed, run the following command and see the cluster's two worker VM instances:

	gcloud compute instances list

### Deploy the application

Pull the image from the Repository and create a Container on the Cluster:

	kubectl run govue-web --image=gcr.io/charged-gravity-258513/govue:v1 --port=8000

To see the Pod created by the Deployment, run the following command:

	kubectl get pods

### Expose the application to the Internet

Expose the Kubernetes Deployment through a Load Balancer:

	kubectl expose deployment govue-web --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080 --target-port=8000

Note: GKE assigns the external IP address to the Service resourceâ€”not the Deployment. If you want to find out the external IP that GKE provisioned for your application, you can inspect the Service with the kubectl get service command:

	kubectl get service

If we open up http://35.201.194.137:8080/ within our browser, we should see that our application is successfully running.
